# UniLink App

UniLink is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help students collaborate on campus. It enables resource swapping (notes, textbooks), carpooling arrangements, study partner matching, and event planningâ€”all in one simple hub. Enhanced with AI for smarter matches, routes, and suggestions. Offline-capable with notifications and a points system for engagement.

## Why UniLink?
- Combines four key features into a student-focused app.
- Promotes collaboration and sustainability (e.g., carpooling reduces emissions).
- Ideal for university demos and quick prototyping.
